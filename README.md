# Customer Churn Prediction Using Tradictional ML and DL

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. The companies are interested in identifying segments of these customers because the price for acquiring a new customer is usually higher than retaining the old one. For example, if Netflix knew a segment of customers who were at risk of churning they could proactively engage them with special offers instead of simply losing them.

In this repository, we will create a simple customer churn prediction model using Telco Customer Churn dataset. We chose a decision tree to model churned customers, pandas for data crunching and matplotlib for visualizations. We will do all of that above in Python.
The code can be used with another dataset with a few minor adjustments to train the baseline model.

## Data
Here we have used Telco Customer Churn dataset for building the prediction model. Dataset is also exist in project folder, you can access easily.
